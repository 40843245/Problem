In 2022/12/25, I have met this problem.
------------------------------------
Problem:
When I try to open the scene by double clicking the icon of the scene in File Explorer,
it can NOT be opened.
Instead, a window popped, saying what app to open the scene.
When I selected an app, the Windows 10 does NOT accept my selection.

------------------------------------
Proceedure:
Before I downgraded OS to Windows 10 from Windows 11,
I created an Unity project with some Unity scene files (.unity) 
with version 2020.3.28f1.
-- named Unity_CameraLookAt_Project2.
I could open the scenes via double click of the icon of the Unity scene files (.unity).
However, after a series of operations.
First I downgraded OS to Windows 10 from Windows 11, 

next I downloaded Unity Hub from Unity official website (since the OS just keeps the files NOT keep the application I downloaded in Windows 11)

then I downloaded Unity Editor 2020.3.41f1 (version 2020.3.41f1) from Unity official website
which its version is higher than 2020.3.28f1.

then I downloaded Unity 2020.3.28f1 package (version 2020.3.28f1) from Unity official website.

Then I do these three things (unordered since I forgot the sequence of things I do)

(1)I want to make Unity Hub shows an options. 
Thus, I moved the directory ".../Program Files/Unity 2020.3.28f1" into ".../Program Files/Unity/Hub/Unity 2020.3.28f1" 
which is in same folder to 2020.3.41f1 I downloaded befored.

(2)I created a Unity new empty project with version (2020.3.41f1). Define the new empty project as projectX.
I tested it, it worked fine.

(3)I copied all files in Assets folder of the Unity_CameraLookAt_Project2 (I created it before) (Unity_CameraLookAt_Project2/Assets/...) 
to the new empty project (projectX),

I tested it again and it worked fine.

However, at this point, I found it strange.

When I opened the scenes by selecting the "open scene" of menu bar in Unity and selected a scene,
the scene can be opened without any error.
But, when I try to open the scene by double clicking the icon of the scene in File Explorer,
it can NOT be opened.
Instead, a window popped, saying what app to open the scene.
When I selected an app, the Windows 10 does NOT accept my selection.

------------------------------------
I had tried:

After I uninstall the 2020.3.28f1 by double clicking the icon of Uninstall.exe 
and I reinstall the Unity 2020.3.28f1 package 

then I created a new empty Unity project file. Let's call projectY.
I copied the files of Assets folder in projectX to projectY.

------------------------------------
That's solved.

------------------------------------
Why?
I think the reason is 
the path of default apps in Windows 10 is NOT correct.


P.S.
I refer the link and do the second way.
